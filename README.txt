This is a personal coding project. It's coded exclusively in python, using the PyGame module. 

To run the code, simply run the tanktest.py python file.

It's a very simple tank game. You can move your tank and there is a single target to fire at. The target does not shoot back.

Main cannon armor penetration depends on angle. Sharper angles of impact increase armor thickness and thus decrease penetration chance. Very steep impact angles ricochet regardless of penetration. However, your tank's cannon has very high armor penetration, so non-penetrations will be unlikely.

CONTROLS:
WASD to move Up/Left/Down/Right
Q to increase zoom, E to reduce zoom
Left click mouse to fire
V to toggle aiming assistance line.

This code is extremely spaghetti, and there is a lot of redundant code/files and bad code. This was a passion project I made with speed and thus not the best coding practices were used. Nevertheless I had fun solving problems and making this thing minimally work.
